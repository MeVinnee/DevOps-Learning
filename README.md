# DevOps Learning Roadmap

Welcome to my DevOps Learning repository! This is a personal space to document my journey and progress as I learn various DevOps concepts, tools, and best practices. The repository is organized by topics, and each folder contains notes, examples, and resources for step-by-step learning.

## ðŸ“š Roadmap

1. **Linux Fundamentals**
    - Start with the basics of Linux: navigation, file management, permissions, and shell scripting.
    - See [`linux/basics/basics-commands.md`](linux/basics/basics-commands.md) for essential commands.
    - Explore networking and security basics.

2. **Version Control with Git**
    - Learn Git basics, branching, merging, and collaboration workflows.

3. **CI/CD Concepts**
    - Understand Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines.
    - Explore tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.

4. **Containers & Docker**
    - Learn about containers, Docker basics, images, and container orchestration.

5. **Kubernetes**
    - Dive into container orchestration, deployments, services, and scaling.

6. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
    - Explore Terraform and Ansible for automating infrastructure provisioning and configuration.

7. **Cloud Platforms**
    - Get hands-on with AWS, Azure, or GCP basics.

8. **Monitoring & Logging**
    - Learn about monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana) and logging solutions (ELK stack).

9. **Other Topics**
    - Add notes, resources, and advanced topics as you progress.
